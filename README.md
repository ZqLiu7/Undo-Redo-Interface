# Undo-Redo-Interface
An interesting use-case of a linked list is to track edits in a "Undo - Redo" interface. 
Create an interface of an application that will alter the contents of a list. 
As we alter the contents of the list, we should be able to retrieve the previous state of the list as we change it, much like being able to undo and redo changes in a document.
